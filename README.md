# Daily Coding Problem solutions

These are solutions to the daily challenges from [dailycodingproblem.com](https://dailycodingproblem.com/). This is a personal project to keep my algorithm skills sharp and learn Python at the same time.

These solutions are *my* attempts, which I produce for my own learning when I have time. They are not "official" solutions, and I am not affiliated in any way with dailycodingproblem.com. Although I do my best to ensure the solutions are correct, I cannot make any guarantees. For solutions endorsed by dailycodingproblem.com, sign up for their Premium plan.

## Running the solutions
To test these solutions, make sure Python 3 is installed, `cd` to the directory containing the solutions, and then run `python <date>.py`. (On some platforms, the command may be `python3 <date>.py`.)
* E.g.: `python 2021_02_27.py` or `python3 2021_02_27.py`
